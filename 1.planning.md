# Planning Protocol – AI-Assisted Coding

## Goal
Describe *what* to build in human terms before any code is generated.

## When to use
- New feature, service, or module.
- Non-trivial refactor or architecture change.

## Steps
1. **Clarify feature**
   - Write a 3–7 sentence description of the feature.
   - List primary users and their goals.
2. **Define constraints**
   - Tech stack and versions (e.g., Rust 1.84, Bevy 0.15, Postgres 16).
   - Non-functionals: performance, security, latency, SLAs.
3. **Write acceptance criteria**
   - 5–10 bullet “Given/When/Then” scenarios.
4. **Draft high-level design**
   - List components, data flows, external APIs.
   - Sketch interfaces (function signatures, structs) in prose or pseudo-code.
5. **Create AI planning prompt**
   - Paste the above into an AI with a request:
     - “Produce an implementation plan: tasks, file-level changes, and open questions. Do *not* write code yet.”

## Output
- `spec/<feature-name>.md` checked into version control.
- A reviewed implementation plan appended to that file.
