# Context Protocol – Shared Memory for AI

## Purpose
Give AI agents stable, persistent context so code stays consistent over time.

## Files
- `CONTEXT.md` – project-wide.
- `context/<feature-name>.md` – feature-specific.

## What goes in CONTEXT.md
- **Architecture summary**: main services, data stores, queues.
- **Coding conventions**: naming, error handling, logging style.
- **Framework patterns**: ECS patterns, DI approach, testing style.
- **Security/privacy rules**: what AI must never log or leak.

## Workflow
1. Update `CONTEXT.md` whenever an architectural decision is made.
2. For a new feature, create `context/<feature>.md` with:
   - Linked spec file(s).
   - Key invariants and domain language.
3. When prompting AI:
   - Paste or reference the relevant sections from `CONTEXT.md` and `context/<feature>.md`.
4. Periodically prune outdated context to avoid drift.

## Example prompt stub
> “You are coding in this project. Here is the architecture and conventions (excerpt from CONTEXT.md: …). Here is the feature context (context/payments-refund.md: …). Follow these exactly.”
