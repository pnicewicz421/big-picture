# Execution Protocol – Systematic Building with AI

## Principles
- Small steps, small diffs.
- One concern per AI request.
- Human reviews every change.

## Steps for a feature
1. **Break into tasks**
   - From `spec/<feature>.md`, derive tasks:
     - e.g., “Add RefundRequest type”, “Implement /refund endpoint”.
2. **One-task prompts**
   - For each task, prompt:
     - “Implement only this task. Modify only these files: [...]. Follow CONTEXT.md rules. No extra features.”
3. **Review & edit**
   - Read AI output.
   - Manually fix naming, safety, domain logic.
4. **Commit**
   - Commit with a clear message referencing spec section.
5. **Repeat**
   - Continue task-by-task until the feature spec is covered.

## Guardrails
- Reject changes that touch files not in the current task.
- Ask the AI to explain non-obvious code before acceptance.
