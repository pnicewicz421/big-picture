# Quality Protocol – Testing & Validation

## Plan–Do–Check–Act loop
1. **Plan**
   - Confirm acceptance criteria from `spec/<feature>.md`.
   - Identify edge cases and failure modes.
2. **Do**
   - Ask AI to propose tests *before* or alongside implementations:
     - unit, integration, property tests.
3. **Check**
   - Run tests locally.
   - Manually inspect risky areas (security, concurrency, I/O).
4. **Act**
   - If tests fail or code smells:
     - Ask AI for a focused fix.
     - Update tests/spec to cover the regression.

## AI testing prompts
- “Generate tests that fully cover this function, focusing on edge cases.”
- “Given these acceptance criteria, write integration tests only.”

## Code review checklist (human)
- Correctness against spec.
- Security & privacy concerns.
- Performance hotspots.
- Consistency with `CONTEXT.md`.
- Adequate test coverage.
