# Documentation Protocol – Clear Technical Docs

## Doc classes
- `README.md` – project overview and quickstart.
- `spec/*.md` – feature-level specs.
- `CONTEXT.md` – architecture & conventions.
- `docs/` – deeper guides (operations, domain models, runbooks).

## Rules
1. **Spec-first**
   - Add or update `spec/<feature>.md` before major coding.
2. **Always backfill docs**
   - Any non-trivial behavior change updates:
     - relevant spec, and
     - relevant section of `README.md` or `docs/`.
3. **Use AI as a doc assistant**
   - Prompt:
     - “Turn this diff into updated docs sections for `README.md` and `spec/payments.md`. Follow existing tone and headings.”
4. **Living documents**
   - Periodically ask AI:
     - “Identify inconsistencies between `CONTEXT.md` and code in /src. Draft corrections.”
   - Review and apply manually.

## Structure conventions
- Short sections, clear headings.
- One concept per file where possible.
- Code snippets must compile or be clearly pseudo-code.
